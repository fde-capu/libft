### library forty two | a bunch of random pure C util functions
#### by fde-capu

This is the first, the core project on a galactic journey through the `C` course for *42 São Paulo*.
It is mandatory to re-code some common functions.
Later on, I did implement many many random generic functions that I would probably need again for other projects.

### Mandatory function re-codings:
memset, bzero, memcpy, memccpy, memmove, memchr, memcmp, strlen, strlcpy, strlcat, strchr, strrchr, strnstr, strncmp, atoi, isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, toupper, tolower, calloc, strdup, 

### Mandatory aditional functions:
ft_substr, ft_strjoin, ft_strtrim, ft_split, ft_itoa, ft_strmapi, ft_putchar_fd, ft_putstr_fd, ft_putendl_fd, ft_putnbr_fd

### Bonus functions:
ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstsize, ft_lstlast, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstclear, ft_lstiter, ft_lstmap.

### Random extra functions (made just because):
Please refer to the header `.h` files for the prototypes. There is a simple intuitive bezier curve implementation, key-press handling, math conversions, string operations (even a mequetrefious regex implementation), color operators, many custom structs and types, memory management tricks, vector and matrices algorithms, debug helpers.

(Thou you should know I have implemented many other *possibly broken* codes.)
